# AtliQ-Hardware-Sales-Insight---SQL-Project
AtliQ Hardware Sales Insight from Ad-Hoc Requests

The challenge was set against Atliq Hardware's need for better insights to make quick and informed decisions. They aimed to expand their data analytics team, led by Tony Sharma, who sought candidates proficient in technical and soft skills through a SQL challenge.
 
In my role as a Data Analyst, I have contributed to uncovering valuable insights for Atliq Hardware. 

Here are three key lessons I've learned:
 
➡️ Command on SQL Syntax: The more I practiced SQL, the more comfortable I became with syntaxes like Common Table Expressions and window functions.
 
➡️ Turning Queries into Visuals: I have learned how to turn SQL queries into
easy-to-understand visuals like charts and graphs, making complex data more accessible.
 
➡️Improving Presentation Skills: Presenting findings clearly and concisely has been crucial. Effective communication has been key to driving discussions and influencing decisions.
